## Inspiration
We realized that there were many students who needed help and some kind of group discussions to understand certain concepts. Despite the TA's and instructors, many students would benefit from a group of similar age to share ideas and discuss certain concepts. 

## What it does
Our website first collects the requirements of each student in terms of:
- The course/ topics they would like to study
- Date and time they intend to study
- Their Location
Our website would then match students with similar schedules and would give them an option to meet in person or virtually. We also intend to instant messaging and a forum portal for them to share their perspective about a certain topic.

## How we built it
We built it using HTML, JavaScript, and firebase. Although, we ran into difficulties while integrating the backend.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into difficulties while integrating the backend. So, we couldn't integrate the data storage.

## What we learned
We got an opportunity to explore web development as we were not familiar with it. 

## What's next for StudyMaps
We plan to work further on our idea and resolve all the errors we have faced while developing the project. We feel that our idea has the potential to help many students around. We intend to instant messaging and a forum portal for them to share their perspective about a certain topic and integrate everything with the database.
